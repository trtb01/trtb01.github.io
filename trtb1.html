        <p>
            I'm ace, agender, and really good with computers! I'm a cyclist, commuting all over town all the time on my beloved and battle-worn ebike. I like cooking, playing flight and driving simulators, and writing! I'm currently a college student, studing networking and IT at CCC. I'm having a great time!

            I'm also an activist in a few different spheres. I've been a board member of a local non-profit for eight years, where we make cycling better in our area for everyone; I've been volunteering there for 20 years total. I also donate a lot of time to the CCC GSA, where I do light outreach and gentle lobbying (as well as a great deal of graphic design and a little copy writing) to make life better for queer students and faculty on and surrounding campus.

            Like I say, I have a lot of fun, have lots of great friends, and do good things.
