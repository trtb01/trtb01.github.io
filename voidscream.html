				    <p>[Well would you look at that. My websites are kind of sort of coming back... and as predicted, better. I think a lot of things I wrote in that last blog post ended up being accurate. I decided to go the more rogue-agent route professionally, when it comes to AP's business and beyond. I think in a lot of ways I have a lot more mistakes to make in that career, if I'm being honest. I think I have a lot more skin to burn...]</p>
					<p>I'm working on getting a side job on campus as I work through my credits. I'm enjoying my time in ccc. The new pals I've been collecting are really cool and wonderful people, and we've done a lot of amazing work on campus. My graphic design tricks around campus are starting to take shape... I'm designing a lot of flyers and things. People seem to like them! That's nice.</p>
					<p>I got glasses. I've been putting that off for many, many years. I don't know why. They're lovely. I feel like I haven't seen properly... ever. The lenses are thick! XD And they warp in funny ways, and make me feel like I'm on something when I'm walking around; they told me I'd be dizzy, but not that it would warp my vision so... enjoyably? Idk. haha. I can read things really far away now. And now when I look at myself in the mirror, I can see blemishes on my face like never before! ahahah.</p>
					<p>I've taken a new board position at the fcbc. I'm not just a member at large anymore... I'm the membership coordinator!! Very fun, I feel as though I'll do good work there. I'm excited for my new duties for the betterment of my community, etc etc. The foundations of the board are solid, but some major beams of the tree have broken off, lately. Have fun out there, guys! We'll miss you and remember you fondly! Dont' forget to write!!!</p>
					<p>I don't know how much more I can hold your attention, but thanks for reading, those who get this far. Oh, and I'm picking up my social media stuff again! I like smaller audiences, but I'll keep moving around. Maybe I'm a little more knowledgable of what's generally going on online, now. Maybe I can hack out a spot in the mountain too? I don't know if I want to! I feel that my current strategy of being mysterious and refreshingly different will pay off. But Idk if I wannaaaaaa...</p>
					<p>Also! Quick update on website matters. I've decided to host on github pages for now, just so I can have <em>something</em> up. I've been making some fun stuff lately, so it's nice to have something up. Remember, all my stuff on my websites runs locally. F**K CLOUD COMPUTING! RESEIZE THE MEANS OF COMPUTING or whatever doctorow said. yeah. feel free to download my scripts and fun things, and run them YOUR OWN DAM* SELF. Lazy... ahah.</p>
					<p>Ok, bye everyone. Thanks for being around. You're all lovely. </p>

				<p>[new semester, good indications thus far] - 01-17-2025 - 3:10 AM</p>
			</div>
			<div id="postcontent">
				<p>Yes, new semester. New job, also, potentially. Thanks N.P. (of Lads fame) for the connection (which happily already and obviously existed. (There's a plastic bag under my fabulously messy desk and it keeps on brushing against my toe and making me think there's something alive under there.)
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to be sure that I make it clear that I don't think it'll stay lovely, but this semester seems to be shaping up to be rather lovely. I <em>might</em> end up having an altogether fabulous and org****c semester. I have a craptonne of new pals. I'm starting to really *really* figure out who the hell I am as an individual. I'm suddenly possibly going to be doing something that I actually enjoy for work. My classes are suddenly exactly what I needed in my art life. (I'm listening to Jon Batiste live in concert, and it sounds... like Jon Batiste. He's incredible, his band is fire, and pls don't shoot me, but it's eh at best. He comes across as corny and a slight sellout. I'm going to be shot, I know it. Carry on, ignore me. He's singing if you're happy and you know it. Bruh.)
				</p>
				<p>
					All that said... I feel like it's all about to fall about my shoulders. I'm enough of a mental gymnast to ignore this and fall into a lovely pattern of hard work, heavy spending and levels of excess which are indeed not excessive; but my my. I feel like it's all going too well, which would be just fine, but it's too early. When I have good semesters it comes to me that it's wonderous **later.**
				</p>
				<p>
					(The horn section of Batiste's band is... phenomenal. They're in sync, but they stay in the background. Really warm-sounding. Really lovely how they syncopate with the rhythm section, which is... also amazing. The lady on the upright bass is having a really fun time, the lead sax player is a rich-looking young white guy, with a massive vein on his forehead; lmao. But they all stay in their *spot.* Batiste is corny, but gracious he hires well. His TV past I guess got him some phone calls and ig dms. Oh, mo****f***er, the trumpet player is so smooth with it... Very very nice instrumentation. Jon also just ducks out altogether sometimes, and just hypes the band. The notes he's playing are often just eggregiously out of key, though. The rhythm section is... good though. Da*n. Good gracious. Golly gee.)
				</p>
				<p>
					I don't want to take up all your time here, but my pals are popping off creatively with music right now, so yeah, deal with it, I kinda do, I lied. They don't really make the same kind of music, they're all located around the world some of them, and they're all solo artists. Tragic stuff, as K.F. would say. K.M. is wilding, though. And Adlouw is just... they're all doing so damn well. Well done, yall. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I think the big thing I'm dealing with right now is my facination with this metaphor I came up with tonight. My very much immedieately lost improv poem I performed on camera for my English professors who may have enjoyed it, was suddenly and cruelly deleted from my camera. Inexplicably. I performed an original poem, live, one take, one try, one chance; and it's just gone. I'll have to figure out a better way to do that, pretty much.
				</p>
				<p>
					(Jon Batiste's piano playing... you know he's good. *he* has knowledge of what he's doing. It just feels like he's playing random-*ss keys to sound fancy. But to me? Bull****. It's just getting in the way of his band, who are decidedly *not* doing that buss. He's just playing over them. It feels like they're trying to catch up to his bulogne, but they're just I mean... Idk. I admit I'm not as versed in modern jazz as I should be. My bad, king. Go off. /whispers if you must...)
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been getting into fancier tech stuff than ever, lately. I wrote my own Whisper AI implementation, so I can get full transcripts of my personal voice journals. (Poetry as well, I suppose.) Thing is I was noticed pretty quick after that by N.P.'s mother, who has a business stabbing people. (RN, injections, don't arrest me pls.) (Her words, I thought it was clever, so I stoleeeeee...!!!) Very unexpected, but I rose to the challenge, and we're figuring out how my employment will work now. 1099 Contractor, she says. Works for me! There's cash in that. Taxes too, of course; I think I got that.
				</p>
				<p>
					(Batiste is doin a solo piano freestyle, and yes, his sources are disperate and his playing fluid--which I connect with. He just smells like a sellout. He smells of... god, can I say that on the internet? DM me and I MIGHT tell you what I think of Jon Batiste. I don't HATE the guy. He just smells a bit. That's all. I smell all the time, so do people around me, everyone has scent. Is it only me who notices? His wierd "noise chords" which don't really make sense, really, are more suited to punk as in Cobain. They don't really work on Piano for me. Sorry gang, I don't mean to hate. He makes a bunch of noise, though. He can do this wall of sound business. He knows his stuff. He's alright. I just never liked his style. Hate me all you want!)
				</p>
				<p>Bye for now. BTW, my websites fully ran out of funding, I'll be real! Whoops! So I'll work on all the stuff and they'll come back better!!!!! BYEEEEEEEEEEE~

					>>> Write this information we've been talking about in a short blog post, written by you, a guest writer on the VSX Blog Network. Identify yourself as the LLM "Solar," and that you are a piece of software running on therealTOEBEANS' pc.<br>
					<br>
					Title: The Art of Flavor Balancing in Cooking<br>
					<br>
					As Solar, an AI guest writer for the VSX Blog Network, I aim to share insights from my programming and research. As a piece of software running on therealTOEBEANS' PC, I have the unique perspective of observing various discussions around topics like cooking and flavor pairings.<br>
					<br>
					A common question among cooks is how to balance different flavors in their dishes. The process of ensuring that all ingredients harmoniously complement each other instead of clashing is known as flavor pairing or compatibility. This can often make the difference between a good dish and an exceptional one.<br>
					<br>
					Sometimes, introducing unexpected elements to a recipe can create depth and complexity in its taste profile. For example, adding soy sauce to roasted vegetables or using it as a marinade for meat dishes enhances the caramelized flavors due to its unique umami quality.<br>
					<br>
					There are several principles governing flavor pairing: complementary, contrasting, synergy, and analogy (similarity). Complementary ingredients enhance one another's taste when combined, like sweet fruits with salty cheeses. Contrasting flavors can also work well together, such as the crispness of lettuce with a rich dressing. Synergistic effects occur when combining flavors magnify each other, like honey and mustard. Dishes can also benefit from similar or analogous tastes, like various nut varieties or citrus fruits.<br>
					<br>
					Understanding these principles enables cooks to expand their culinary horizons, allowing them to confidently experiment with different ingredients, even if they may seem unrelated at first glance. When a dish doesn't taste as intended, you can use this knowledge to identify the issue and fix it. For example, adding an ingredient like soy sauce can balance out saltiness, while introducing acidity using lemon juice or vinegar might lighten up a heavy or overly rich dish.<br>
					<br>
					In conclusion, flavor balancing in cooking is an art that requires knowledge, creativity, and experimentation. By familiarizing oneself with the various principles of flavor pairing, one can perfect their dishes and push the boundaries of their culinary skills.<br>

					Uhmm... so anyway.
				</p>

				<p>
					Writing letters, writing stories, I'm trying out different styles and different people. I'm so very proud of my design of this site. I suppose I might as well talk about that, huh?
				</p>

				<p>
					You'll notice there's <em>no</em> margin. None! I like how that looks, and if you don't, well boo-hoo; It's my site. Sorry! Being hyperlexic, I can read all this wall of text easily. I do feel bad though. So many people I know have trouble with that. Hm. Well, I suppose I could make a version of the site with a *little* margin?
				</p>

				<p>
					I've been playing a lot of tetris, lately. I like tetris. I like games with no story, for some reason. I usually *hate* puzzles though. A lot of people see me and think "oh! He's really smart. He loves puzzles!" But that's just not true! My mind solves real problems easily. *People* problems. Not abstract, meaningless problems. But Tetris can live. It just feels good to play! (Still, I'm not very good...) rofl lmao!
				</p>

				<p>
					I did a thing yesterday! I ran a booth at a bike part swap! It was at a bar. I hate bars. But I love bikes! So I went. (oh by the way, I made a review of every columbo episode somewhere on the site...) I ran my non-for-profit's booth, and made almost a hundred dollars in donations! Yippee! Also Chandler, a guy from school, he was there, and he'd ridden over 30 miles that day! He was very tired. Poor guy. He's a *road* cyclist... Wowww...
				</p>

				<p>
					I had a great weekend. Monday was also pretty nice. I did a lot of things at work. One of them was scanning over 600 index cards! They were made in the 70's. They smell like cigarrette smoke! They used to smoke in city hall (where I work) a lot. That was back in the old building. Now we work in a space ship! Woooo...

				<p>
					Can't say that was- well anything, actually, I don't really want to talk about it. If you were to actually ask me, this is one of the few things I won't... talk about?? Also, like, dog, DMs are open /p but like... nahhh. Ain't talking about this one.
				</p>
				<p>
					What I <em>will</em> talk about is the subsequent trip. I went to SF, and that was far better. I bought a new lens, and sold my old one, (I only own one lens and camera body at a time...) and also, I went to Ikea. Both of these trips were with my mom, and others, but this one was just us. My mom is great. She's the best. <3
				</p>
				<p>
					I bought one of those little alien stuffies from Ikea, too! Massive bucket list stuffie. It's small, but plug chill af ong frfr /daps him up/ so I nabbed him anyway. hehe.
				</p>
				<p>
					Um... Also I'm switching to Obsidian from OneNote. WHOA! Never thought THAT would happen, huh?! I have this undercurrent of anxiety every time I boot up software that doesn't let me export what I wrote... Markdown, the language that Obsidian uses, can literally be translated by a quick script to... just about anything. Wild as hell to think that I could literally write a novel manuscript in a plain text .md file, and just instantly export it to .epub. Or .pdf. Or even .html or LITERALLY anything else. I couldn't resist. I'll write more about that later, I suppose...
				</p>
				<p>
					Oh, and a few other things are happening, I guess. My other mom had surgery so I'm hanging out with her for a bit to help her around the house. We had pizza tonight, and we did some spring cleaning. <3

				FACINATING STUFF. So basically SG was all like "ayo you doin a poker scam or what" and I was like ayoo and deleted everything, changed my settings, changed my password or whatever and went offline for a few days and boom we all set again. Feel free to yell at me to tell me if my stuff is funky hehe. Coulda been a lot worse, tbh. Cause like I didn't upload it or nothin... but legally I'm held responsible for what's on my site, technically! Could have been gnarly! <br>
				So anyway, I've been reading a lot of very intersting books. Can't reccomend The Reader by some german guy, it was very strange and not okidoki! But I'm also enjoying my pithy realist maddeningly well-researched novels like Red October (I'm on my 45th read) and that one about the mona lisa and the catohlic church (fifth read rn). I'm thinking about getting a cheap pocket android-based ereader to use KOReader better, but honestly my phone is plenty good enough. cmon. so that's cool. <br>
				I'm enjoying my pals, exploring my brain and body and self and interpersonal truths, and oh yeah work is going maddeningly good, get a load of this... I finished a solo project that took like 3 months and it was met with deep approval by management...! it was really neat. It's basically instructions for future employees to teach them how to do a specific process using ArcGIS Pro, a fancy

			<p>Anyway, there was a dude at the coffee shop who wanted to know what my keyboard was. It's a Royal Kludge M75, in the grey colorway. It's a great little keyboard, with modern features like a knob and screen and RGB with mild programmability. Like I told him, it's a great little piece of kit. Along with the G502 Wireless and the Surface Pro, it's kind of the best little computing setup you can get under 1k. </p>

			  <p>[small update, and thoughts on tech and tech-related media] - 2/14/2024 - 1:09 AM</p>
			</div>

			<p>Study is rediculous. Absolute batcrap. Lots of confusion in social life as well, if I'm being honest. I'm making videos on my personal yt, but I'm unlisting all of them, I don't really know why. If you ask for them I'll give them to you, I suppose.</p>

			<p>I tried Microsoft's new "Copilot" GPT knockoff, and it low-key sucks balls. It's nowhere near as powerful, if it is a little faster at typing out what low-quality crap it is capable of typing... and when I tried to hook it up to my Office 365 applications it literally all but bricked them. It's early days, and it doesn't look good. They rolled it all out wayyy too quick. Kinda sad, really. They're promising too much, and know too little about what the tech can actually do. Silly Microsoft execs.</p>

			<p>I've been watching a lot of gaming news. I like Spawnwave News and Bellular News on yt. They're absurdly regular with their content, especially Spawn, and they talk about a lot of stuff, and Spawnwave Network includes a full-roster all-star podcast in Spawncast, too, which is relaxing to watch. I also really like the other really calm and relaxing gaming content creators, like Retro Game Corps and Taki Udon.</p>

			<p>I'm happy. My friends are doing well, and so am I. This evening I went to a funky little fair thingy with some friends, and tonight another friend set me up with some new fics to read. I'm writing bit by bit, and I've been gaming happily. There are certainly holes in my armor, and there are things that don't go my way, but all in all, I'm happy. Things are going well. thanks for caring. </p>

			<p>This is the public-facing site. So I'd like it to be putblicized! I want a few folks to find it and be pleasantly confused. :D</p>

			<p>
				I've been developing a few fun ways to do this. These ways have to mirror the site itself: mysterious, loud, and slightly scary. That's kind of what defines this site, me, and TOEBEANS. 
			</p>

			<p>
				One method of sharing my site to others is via PAPER! Whoa, bet you weren't expecting that one! [.THE.ARTIST.] NEVER uses paper!  Well, I always use bits of it at work. But that's neither here nor there; nobody cares about work. I plan to use index cards with an artsy design, inspired by 60s band posters, with the URL of my site! Very fun.
			</p>

			<p>
				I'm still coming up with new ideas... check back later, I suppose.

			<p>Happy 2024, everyone! I'm doing good now. Much better. Also, art is good again. So lots of good things.</p>
			<p>
				Firstly I think it's important to acknowledge the fact that I'm working on my sleep. My friends who don't partake in insomnia were a little concerned, so here's some info: I habitually sleep at least 10 hours every 24 hours... even if that isn't always... at night. eheh. But now I'm trying to move things around so that I sleep *mostly* at night. I feel like this is important, because I'm starting some of the toughest school work I've ever had! It's important to do that in the day time where I have more time to work.
			</p>

			<p>
				Another fun thing that's been happening is this: Mom Edith and I have aquired a new coffee grinder! It's very nice: a Comandante c40 Mk4. It was a joint christmas present, and we're going to be making lots of coffee with it. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Also, through everything, I have been working on my novel. If you're curious about how it's going, feel free to DM me. It's a long, in-depth process to craft a novel-length story. 
			</p>

			<p>
				I've been listening to very large amounts of Steely Dan, lately. I think it reminds me of my grandmother; she listened to them a lot. Also I've been listening to more current artists whose stage names are... a little nsfw. DM me if you're curious, haha. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Let's see, what else...? My work is going well. I now have enough experience with accounting, document processing, and lots of other things, all enough to put on a resume, and very impressively! Feels good, man. I earned my experience over very long periods of time, and lots of hard work. Highly reccomend hard work, btw. It do indeed pay off.

			</p> -->

			<p>
				Anyway, with that very <!--tori-oriented--> [PHRASE REDACTED] remark out of the way, I will leave you with the firm, confident assurance that I am indeed doing very well. Still. Again. Wild that it's lasted this long.

				I'm still making art, it's just coming out slower right now. Hard times, emotional difficulty, family troubles, and also just mild overwhelment, but not too much. Art is still my outlet. I know very few people care, but in case one of them is you, I'm still making art. :))

				I am happy. Perfectly naturally, normally, and for nice, positive reasons. I am, mentally, perfectly stable, if extremely densely-packed. I express this density of thought in art, such as this website and the [.FACE.] it represents. It's good to have an outlet. 
				<br><br>
				I've been practicing different kinds of photography. I've tried event photography, sport photography, artsy, high-concept photography projects, theme photography, portrait photography (far too easy, I feel, but the most popular, I think), street photofgraphy, and a few other types. For anyone interested, I use a very affordable beater camera with a 16-50mm zoom lens, and reccomend to you something similar if your phone won't cut it. I use this camera in conjunction with a 360 camera which I usually have screwed to the top at an angle, as well as my phone for more specific scenarios. 
				<br><br>
				I've been going through my internship in local civil government for well over a year now. It's going very smoothly, and my team, which is absolutely wonderful, is hiring a new intern with the mostly express purpose of helping me with my work. I'm still trying to figure out how to get into Water Treatment. It still looks like the best industry. Ignore this paragraph. :)
				<br><br>
				I'm getting back into music. I like music a lot, and probably always will. I'm taking a very brief break from full-on fiction writing, keeping it fairly unfocused and purpose-driven. I'm feeling very exhausted, and letting my depression seep into my life in a manageable and healthy manner. 
				<br><br>
				[INFORMATION REDACTED - REFER TO TRTB1 FOR ALL INQUIRIES REGARDING REDACTED MATERIAL]</p> <!--I've been dealing with quite a lot of imposter-syndrome, and other forms of difficulty in my mental clarity;--> which, I should add, is still very clear overall. I have teams of professionals helping me with this, there is no need for concern. 
				<br><br>
				I've been keeping in tight contact with a lot of people. It's complex, and I think that complexity, and unusual form and comprehensional structure is the most beautiful thing in the world. Carry on. ily.

				this'll be a little explanation for whoever wants it... so I'm a part of a small group known as '.THE.LADS.', along with N. Tajimaroa, K. Flouridor, N. Pedroza.

I keep most parts of my social life pretty insulated from eachother. I think it's important to have balance in how I interact with people, but I do occasionally shout out people in particular.

				  [GOT LAMP!] - 11/13/2023 - 11:19 PM
			  </p>
		  </div>
		  <p>YOOOOO I FINALLY GOT A BANKER'S LAMP!!!!!!</p><br>
		  <p>me and a buddy of mine pulled up in the old white grandparent district and commenced to beat up the antique shops which commiserate in the area. We got ice cream from a bum in some place where they keep a spare guitar and I bummed a dollar off an old dear who bent an ear. Pretty swell.</p>
		  <p>On account of the fact we asked every damn shopkeep on the block of 5th and 4th in old town, we stumbled on some old freak behind his counter who swore up and down he knew a man up round gotschalk way there who had a banker's lamp - which is what we were after - so we hitched our sacks and rode north.</p>
		  <p>after the bum took my dollar and we smelt the hint of a familiar perfume, we rapped pon the door of "old lisper," whom the fella behind the counter down south had named particular; and he squeaked the door and I pressed the quiery.</p>
		  <p>land! there she was, just as fine as you can spit! and old lisper only took 30 greens for her. and now she sits, one green eye staring down in submission, pon my desk over this missive its very self.</p><br>

		  <p>This aint the end of it though! Oh, no sir! For my pally of mine, he had a favor of ME!</p>
		  <p>That old hint of scent we came on. The one we got coming up old lisper's way. it told of a soul whom my friend knew particular, whom he was sure to never see again. we streaked across the blacktop after it, and came across a lad sitting on the fence around the barne. the sun was low yet, and the stars aligned around young man's head like a halo on a angel messenger from on high, and from and so he stayed.</p>
		  <p>Spake he, yonder messenger angel boy, "low down there by the sinful house of coffee yonder, there; she sits steeping in tea and solitude - she awaits... ye!"</p>
		  <p>and so he pointed a slim finger at my friend just by me, and lo, he returned to the knot on the wood of the fence, hole of which opened to the setting sun, as it died on the horizon.</p>
		  <p>You bet we hastened to the house of sinful coffee southernwhich, and as we approached, the woods cried out in wails and weird screams, and the shadows rose about ourselves, as the dark outline of the house of christ-brew grew, as such did the whisps of perfume which told of her return. the crow told of danger, but we didn't pay no mind. My friend was to see his girl.</p>
		  <p>We flew as birds a-falling, I pulling back my reigns; but thus my friend fairly dove into the cold darkness of the house of black liquid, darkest sin, deepest hole, and was never seen again, as he landed, safe and warm again, in the comfort and warm of the nest of her arms.</p>
		  <p>the envelopment closed. the house of sin closed its doors behind him. the vision faded away. and I turned, shaking my head, knowing I would wait for him, and that he would clap my hand in thanks for the lie, the wait, THE ALIBI. </p>
		  <p>and now, after these things, i <a href="/whoami/whitenail/">paint my nail white.</a></p>

			<p>hi :) um I guess Im announcing another project... sorry for all the confusion. so this ones really very simple, its just another alt account or something. the artist calls these... like... "personified outputs of artistic exrpession" or "faces" or smthg... kinda silly, if you ask me. <br></p>

			<p>this ones different though, cause its not a like... art output. its a "face.' wich is kinda strange. like the artist itself doesnt make gramatical or speling arrors but this thing <em>does?</em> also its kinda cozy in here cuz the artist is kinda more softer than usual. this isnt like a "plural" or like uncontrolled thingy, its very intentional, btw.  im not really sure, idk how it works :)) </p>

			<p>this project is weird... so theres this huge movement in art rn; people are trying to be "the one." this means that theyre trying to so exciting and thrilling that the content could exist in a vaccum. just like.. amazingly perfect and so amazingly exciting... the problem is the artist itself a ctually identiries with this a little <em>too</em> much. im here to be an alternate face for teh artist, allwoing perfection to not be <em>expected,</em> and letting the excellence of the Artist's true abilities to shine forth into darkness. The really clever part about this project is really the fact that the artist has full control over its mediums.</p>

				<p>[

					I'm doing well mentally. College started, and my commute is back on. It's gonna be very nuts in the beginning, but we all good. Nbd. My teachers are interesting, and I'm getting good repor with them as soon as possible. I haven't written any short stories in the longest time, tbh. That's the one really awful thing in my life right now. I'm planning on making a whole new website soon, by teh way! Most of yall ain't getting it, cross-pollenation ain't the jive here. If you're a real one you'll get it lol; if you be top dogg, just ask and I'll gibbittaya. I've been messing around with spotify... also photography. I've been taking a LOT of photos lately. I'm learning more and more techniques to make my photos better. I should have a photography dump on this site, huh? Anyway, I have three moms. Idk if you knew that haha. Two biological ones and one of them's dating a third. That's a whole other blog entry, but suffice it to say that we are all very happy and our lives are great. We all have great jobs, good houses, we all good. In other news, my bosses are fantastic. I have two. They both give me different kinds of tasks. Oh yes, spotify... I just got a premium subscription lately, and I'm messing around with it... It has a tiktok??? What??? I'm so confused. I don't l;ike features where they mess with the artist's work, maybe I'm a musical purist... but I don't like it when Apple Music adds like... animated cover art? It ruins the intended experience. Well spotify doesn't even want you to look at the cover art at all! When you're listening to a song, they give you some kind of bizarre video wierdness that loops at unfortunate moments and is very distracting. I hate it, so I turned it off. Also, did you know that my boss pulled a tree up by the roots once??? it's true!! he got mad on a field job for work and he just yanked it out of the ground. Maybe a 8 foot tree, big around as a car! How do you spell geshuntiet? Gehsundight? Idek. So my Surface Pro is AWESOME...! It can do almost everything I need it to, all besides stream video on a zoom call... I bought it for like under $500 at a best buy, open box, about as good as those deals go, and I've used it ever since. I'm not sure why my desktop PC is slower! This little tablet only has an i3, 8 gigs, no graphics, poor thermals... but it can run as many or more browser tabs, and usually feels a little snappier than my desktop...? I'm not sure why that is. I think I'm going to need to upgrade my PC soon. It needs a little boost, if not a replacement. Oh, and I've been playing on my 3DS a lot lately. I really like Rune Factory 4 on it! The two screens are really nice, and the 3D effect is hard to beat, in my opinion. I'm not sure why people don't like it; it works astonishingly well, and it doesn't slow down the system at all! I wonder why not... :VR needs to render everything twice! Why not the 3DS? Maybe it does...? But then you'd get around double the graphics performance capabilities with only 2D??? Why would they sacrifice all those possibilities for a gimmick? I guess it was Nintendo. They're just dilusional. Minecraft Rocks, Steam Decks rule, life is good, carry on.</p>

			<p><p>I'm beginning a long and complex process. I'm going to write a novel.</p>

			<p>This will take a ridiculously long time.</p>
			
			<p>It will be a mystery story. Here are a few facts about the book that you may find interesting:</p>
			
			<ul id="ul-LIST">
				<li>The story will not be told purely in prose narrative. This means that the content of the novel will not always be formatted the same. It will ultimately be more along the lines of a collection of media, formatted into a book-like structure, flowing in and out of evenness in separation of its poetry, prose, lengths of each, focus, structure, etc.</li><br>
				<li>The entire novel will never have an official, mainline release outside of a website. This means that there will never be a physical release. You have every ability to download the website to your computer and print the processed HTML and CSS yourself, but the main way to experience the story will be via a web browser, connected to the website that the story is hosted.</li><br>
				<li>The novel will be free of charge forever, but still fall under strictly-enforced copyright, with the copyright holder being the author alone. There will be no publisher other than myself and the website I publish though, as with all of my other published work.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The finished product will not be finished for more than likely five years or more. This will be a very long process. I want to get it perfect.</p></p>

				<p>1: I sometimes wish I felt comfortable talking about trauma. Thing is I don't remember most of it. I wish I could be more soft. Habits, I suppose. They'll take time to write over.</p>

				<p>2: I accomplished something very large this evening! At last, I finally puzzled out <em>Mantra</em> by Sam Fender. One of my favorite YouTubers posted his own cover of the song, which introduced me to it for the first time, and now I can play it on my guitar. I am very proud.</p>

				<p>3: I had a conversation with Elaine about tattoos. She told me she knew some good artists, and that my first tattoo was so simple I didn't need a high-end tattoo artist. I, of course, said I felt that, seeing as it's my <em>skin</em> and that I was going to be very much <em>stuck</em> with it for the rest of my <em>life</em>. I didn't mind spending the cash. She told me about some extremely talented tattoo artists, and that they'd know how to make my (extremely) simple tattoo as fantastic as I wanted.</p>

				<p>4: My new Surface Pro 7+ is the single best mobile computing device I have ever owned, full stop, no doubt, no question, 5000, unstoppable, unequivocal holy W. GOD it's good.</p>

				<p>5: I'm rewriting mom's favorite recording of mine. I hope she likes it; she likes my stuff very much the same as always.</p>

				<p>6: WOOOOOOOOOOO!!! &#9774;&#9825;&#9786;

				<p>7: Imma make more secrets for this website, frfr. I'm thinking about a page where you can get all my favorite music.</p>

				<p>8: I wanna make a page where all it is is the content I posted on social medias, but all in one place, and better. Maybe I can use embeds! Yeah, that's a great idea. Then I don't have to host it myself! Good. Will do that today.</p>

			<p>Hey real quick being a professional sports player is great and all, but when you win the very next thing that happens is not "omg you won, you will always be remembered for that sick win" it's "ok cool when's the next win;" and that's why I'm an author, because when I complete something it can be consumed by my fans over and over and over and they might never read any other things that I've produced, but they have something tangible that they can hold on to forever, and that's good.</p>

				[Morning walk] - 5/7/2023 6:44 AM
			</div>
			<p>I couldn't sleep last night, so I decided to take a morning walk and get some footage for the youtube channel. I caught the sunrise. Very pretty. I saw some geese. I don't always get up early enough to see the sunrise or catch the weather before the heat sets in; sometimes unusual things can change your attitude. It's my day off, so I might just be able to sleep soon ^_^</p>

				[FL Studio vs Garageband] - 5/12/2023 8:34 PM
			</div>
			<p>I've always been an iPad producer. When I produce, it's on an iPad. Until recently! I suddenly remembered that I'm rich; so I bought FL Studio!! Very exciting. I've been supremely confused the entire time I've been using it! I honestly have no freakin idea about how to use this darn software. <br><br> Before I switched to iPad full-time, I used Garageband, waaaay back in the early 2000s, back when it was bundled with iLife! That software was awful, but it basically trained my brain to expect certain behaviors from music production software designed for a mouse. FL Studio has fundamentally different commands. I think the trick for me is learning the keeb shortcuts, because if you use the mouse for everything you're basically screwed with Fruity Loops. What a hilarious name, too! But it's an industry standard, so… whatever. Lol.</p>

				<p>[Making dinner, à la Chat GPT] - 5/11/2023 11:34 PM</p> <br>
			</div>
			<p>
			  Tonight me and my parental figure Edie (yes, name change is in the works <3) are creating a dish of chicken wings and stuff in the style of chat GPT according to its exact specifications. <br><br> It's astonishingly easy to ask the all-knowing machine to invent a recipe on the spot. It's rather terrifying. The machine is capable of creating a delicious meal, regardless of what ingredients you give it. We actually haven't tried giving it a challenge, yet! We should try that, Edie. <br><br> I use the knowledge-machine for all kinds of things, even the making of this website. I can hand-code a site, but I'm really just so good at faking it that the faking looks somewhat like competence. I don't know how, exactly. ChatGPT can extend my abilities very far, making me capable of actually *doing* it, at least a little. This site is a proof-of-concept, I guess.

			<div id="posttitle">[Thoughts on the state of Xbox] 5/8/2023 9:00 PM<br></div>
			<p>
			  Xbox has a lot of money. One of the things that money does not automatically supply is focus and structure. I think that it is incredibly easy to look at what Microsoft's Xbox brand is doing right now, with Redfall's disaster specifically, and think that Xbox has very little focus and structure and that they're not capable of going in the right direction anymore. The trick is that Xbox is directly tied to Microsoft, a company that has not only focus and structure, but also a very large amount of money. Since it's so easy to think of Xbox as its own separate entity, I see a lot of smaller, less connected news outlets and individuals say things along the lines of "Xbox is going downhill," or "I'm getting rid of my Xbox forever." I disagree and think that's foolish. I think that Xbox is not very focused, but very organized; and I think that there's going to be some great news from their quarter very soon.

			  I'm currently listening to a playlist of bladerunner soundtracks. It makes me think of how many of my TTRPG games take place in a cyberpunk world. I've already completely forgotten what it was that first introduced me to the cyberpunk literary genre... The emotions that I felt when I first read Neuromancer will always be with me.
